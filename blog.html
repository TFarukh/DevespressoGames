                <h3>Vambrace: Cold Soul is the name of our upcoming title. It is the culmination of building upon everything we learned during the development of The Coma: Recut. We've invested a great deal of time overhauling our approach to animation, game design, programming, and much more. It is a more polished, sophisticated result of what four guys can do when they have enough time.</h3>
                <h3>Let's start with the bad news by pulling it off like a band aid. As some of you may have noticed, we've closed the community forums. Unfortunately, it just wasn't getting the traction we intended and also ended up attracting loads of spammers. Policing it took more effort than we deemed necessary. Thank you to all fans who participated in the community and made our site a brighter place. Perhaps we'll revisit this initiative someday in the future.</h3>
